# Dekaranger: My second mobile game
A game of the CODING INSPIRATION 2016

It is my unforgettable memories!! When I was student in highschool, I participated a contest for student of University.

In 2016, I taught myself Unity2d and developed a mobile game, named Reverse Car (Now i don't keep the source code :disappointed_relieved:). And I found an information of a game developing contest. Luckily, I found 3 brothers to create a team.
With my idea, I based on my old game. My role was Game Designer, and I created game scripts and features. That year, my team reached the top 4.
